This project is based on the one-week event Next Level Week by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) in which a web application, a mobile app and an API has been built from scratch. 

In this web app, which is named **Find your Duo** users may find other people to play with by publishing announcements.The announcements contain the date and time for the gaming, and contact information so that interested parties can communicate with the person who made the announcement.

It was used ReactNative, ReactJS, Typescript, Tailwind, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL for this project.
