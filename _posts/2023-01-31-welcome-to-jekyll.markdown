title: "Find My Duo"
---

This project is based on the one-week event promoted by Rocketseat in which a web application was built from scratch. 

In this web app users may find other people to play with by publishing announcements. The announcements contain the date and time for the gaming, and contact information so that interested parties can communicate with the person who made the announcement.

It is built using React JS, Typescript and Tailwind for the front-end. And for the back-end we have a NodeJS server using express, and the sqlite database.
