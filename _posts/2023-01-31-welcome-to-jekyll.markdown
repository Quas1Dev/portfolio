title: "Find My Duo"
---

This project is based on the one-week event promoted by Rocketseat in which a web application where users may find other people to play with was built. Users can announce that they are looking for a partner to play with. The announcements contain the date and time of the game, and contact information so that interested parties can communicate with the person who made the announcement.

It is built using React JS, Typescript and Tailwind for the front-end. And for the back-end we have a NodeJS server using express, and the sqlite database.
