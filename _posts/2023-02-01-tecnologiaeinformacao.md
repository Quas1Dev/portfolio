title: "Tecnolog e Informação"

This project consists of a tutorial blog, where I post tutorials (mainly) on programming, but also about other tech stuff. 

It has been built using pure CSS, HTML, and JS. Following the JAMStack architecture, any function that requires a server is outsorced to a service provider.
